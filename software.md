Integrates the most advanced computational techniques, as bioinformatics, 
computational modelling, computational biochemistry and genomics, and systems
biology.

The advent of -omics technologies is changing biology and life sciences from
descriptive disciplines into data-intensive sciences. Within the FEM Research and 
Innovation Centre (CRI), the Computational Biology Unit is the reference for 
the analysis and statistical modeling of data, with a particular emphasis on 
"omic" technologies. The Unit conjugates original methodological research with
the collaboration with the other groups of CRI in a variety of projects. The 
main research areas are: genomics, in particular of plants and bacteria, 
metagenomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, statistical modeling and data 
integration.

In addition, the Computational Biology Unit manages the High 
Performance Computing infrastructure of CRI and guarantees the storage and 
traceability of data generated by high throughput technologies.
