#### [micca](http://micca.org/) | MICrobial Community Analysis
![Alt](img/wp.png "Title") micca (MICrobial Community Analysis) is a software pipeline for the processing 
of amplicon sequencing data, from raw sequences to OTU tables, taxonomy
classification and phylogenetic tree inference. The pipeline can be applied to 
a range of highly conserved genes/spacers, such as 16S rRNA gene, Internal 
Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA.

#### [minepy](http://minepy.readthedocs.io/) | Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration
minepy provides an ANSI C, Python and MATLAB library for the Maximal
Information-based Nonparametric Exploration (MIC and MINE family).


#### [PhyloRelief](https://github.com/compmetagen/phylorelief/wiki) | Phylogenetic-based Feature Weighting
PhyloReliefimplements an algorithm that introduces the Relief strategy of 
feature weighting in a phylogenetic context to identify those OTUs or groups of 
OTUs that are correlated for the differentiation between classes of samples 
(i.e. healthy vs. disease, lean vs. obese etc.) in a metagenomic dataset.


#### [cwave](http://cwave.readthedocs.io/) | Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
cwave is a Python2/3 library implementing the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)
using FFT as in *A Practical Guide to Wavelet Analysis by C. Torrence and G.P. 
Compo*.
